# hello-world
Hoping this training demo sticks!

I started some of the GitHub training going "uh oh..." only to have a complete epiphany at about 7PM that Git and GitHub are actually two different items.
You don't need git commands to start repositories, start branches, make and commit changes, nothing!
I'm truly a newbie.  Over 15 years in clinical system project management - I feel like I'm starting all over!
